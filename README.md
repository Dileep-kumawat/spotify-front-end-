## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML** – Page structure
- **CSS** – Styling and layout
- **JavaScript** – Dynamic functionality (file handling, playback)

---

## 📂 How It Works

1. The user clicks the file input and selects one or more audio files.
2. JavaScript dynamically lists the selected songs on the page.
3. Clicking on a song item creates a local URL and plays it using the browser's `<audio>` element.
4. No upload or server interaction takes place — it’s fully client-side.
